Welcome back to Lab 5\! In this lab, we will practice **rapid prototyping**. For this lab, focus on going through the cycle of ideation to prototype to playtest to iteration **as fast as you can**.

Here’s the situation. You are tragically employed as a design by a terrible, demonic game director who constantly changes their mind. A completely unrealistic scenario, I know. 

Every ???? amount of time, the director will call out a change in the vision of the game. Take the base game and modify it to suit the demon director’s whims. Careful, you only have a limited period of time to make something that works, so get to prototyping and iterating as fast as you can. 

Don’t worry about making a great game. Focus on making any game that satisfies the criteria and isn’t broken – then you can worry about improving it.

**Small Tips:** 

* Incorporating the ideas from multiple designers is hard. Try to let go of idea ownership and just go with one thing at a time. Not every great idea is going to fit into one game, and that’s ok.   
* When in doubt, stop debating and prototype.  
* Need to tie-break between several good ideas? First idea with a prototype plan wins. 

**Base Game: Go Fish**
