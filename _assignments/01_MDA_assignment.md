Let’s practice analyzing the relationship between game mechanics and the player experience they create. Using the [Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics framework](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/MDA.pdf), analyze a game of your choosing. No need to write an essay – there’s no required length for this assignment, but you should be as specific as possible.

1. Choose a game to analyze. The game can be digital or analog or physical but should be reasonably complex.

2. Write a *short* description of the game. You should describe
- The high-level player experience. If you were the game director, how would you describe the vision of this game?
- If applicable, the objective of the game
- If applicable, the narrative premise of the game
- The procedure of the game. In brief, what is the player doing?

3. Choose three mechanics from this game. For each mechanic, provide a breakdown of
- The mechanics: what is the game “rule”?
- The dynamics: what player behavior does this elicit?
- The aesthetics: what emotional response does this evoke?

4. Write a brief reflection on how the three mechanics you’ve chosen work together to support the vision of the game. Or don’t!
