For this assignment, you will be analyzing the relationship between narrative and gameplay. The goal is to understand how these elements can work together, or not\!

1. Over the next week, find and document an instance of Skeuomorphic design that you encounter in your life, where an object or concept is clearly designed in analogy to another to make its function clearer. For example, an icon for a calendar app that is designed to look like a paper calendar (but don’t use that one – too obvious\!). Just note it down briefly, provide a picture if you can. Icons and tools are a safe bet. Bonus points if you can find a physical object, not an icon.   
     
     
2. Select one of the following games and play at least 20 minutes of it (We encourage you to stream on discord as you play so others can join in. You may play with a classmate. Watching a live stream counts as play). These games are all available on the course discord account, login details shared in class.  
   1. Florence  
   2. Papers Please  
   3. What Remains of Edith Finch

   

   If you feel strongly about a different game that is a good example of narrative or theme and mechanics working together, you may request permission to analyze that game instead.

   

   When you’re finished, write a *brief* reflection on the relationship between story/theme and gameplay. How do the mechanics convey the theme or story?

3. Write a *brief* reflection on a time you’ve experienced ludonarrative dissonance. How did the mechanics of the game and the theme/story pull in different directions?  
     
     
4. Write a short reflection about the themed version of Crazy Eight that you prototyped in lab class. Although you created the game as a group, **please do the reflection individually**. The ability to write game design docs is a core designer skill\! Keep in mind that we will be finalizing this game in the next lab. Answer the following questions:  
* **Game Title:** What is the name of your modified version of Crazy Eights?  
* **Story Theme & Rule Constraint:** What **theme** did your group draw? What **rule constraint** did your group choose?  
* **Story Background (\<100 Words):** Describe the setting and narrative of your game. What is the world like? What are the players' roles within it?  
* **New Gameloop:** What changes did you make to the original Crazy Eights rules to fit the theme and constraint? Briefly describe your modified gameloop.  
* **How the Theme Supports the Rules:** How does the theme help players understand and remember the new game mechanics?  
* **Final Playtest Reflection:** What part of the game loop worked and what not? Please share with us some of the interesting scenarios that your group came across during the playtest.
