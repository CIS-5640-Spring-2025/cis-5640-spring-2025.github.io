Over the next eight weeks, you will pair up with another student to learn a skill from them while teaching them a skill of your own. By April 8th, you will have submitted a 5-minute video or    
write-up of comparable depth showcasing your progress, feedback on what it is like to teach and be taught a new skill, and reflections on what you've learned as a designer.

**Pairing and Skill Selection**  
Each student will pair up and decide on a skill to teach and learn. The skill does not have to relate to game design or computer graphics. Instead, think of something practical, creative, or technical that can be meaningfully developed over a few sessions and is NOT related to gaming. You should choose a skill that you can comfortably teach a beginner and that can be practiced in a structured way.

For example:

* Learning to cook a specific dish, starting with basic knife skills and culminating in making dumplings from scratch  
* Learn the basics of calligraphy, beginning with basic strokes and progressing to writing a short passage in a chosen script  
* Learn to fold a specific origami model, along with some basics  
* Learn a short dance sequence

**Progress**  
Throughout the eight weeks, spend time with your partner to both learn and teach your respective skills. Document your time spent together and skill progression in a format that is best suitable for your skills. For instance, if you are learning level design, screenshots of a scene progressing from your blockout to the finalized design would suffice. You should meet up at least 2-3 times (don’t have to be long sessions).

**Submission Format**  
By April 8th, you will have submitted a 3 to 5 minute video or write-up of comparable depth in preparation for an in-class discussion. Your video or write-up should include:

* A brief overview of the skill you learned  
* A demonstration of the skill in action, if applicable  
* Reflections on the learning process and documentation  
  * How did you progress over time?  
  * What was difficult to understand?  
  * What was easy to understand?  
  * What was most helpful to your learning process?   
  * Do you have an idea of how to continue progressing this skill?  
  * What might have made your learning process smoother or more positive?
