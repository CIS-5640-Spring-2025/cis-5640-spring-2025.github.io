**Hello everyone, welcome to the course!** We hope you are enjoying your holiday break! To give you a glimpse of what this class will involve, we are introducing **Assignment #0:**

This low-pressure assignment is meant to ease you into the semester’s style while letting you explore a familiar game with a designer’s mindset.

Don't worry—it’s designed to be easy and should only take about **1-2 hours** to complete. You also have plenty of time to finish it, as the deadline is during the **second week of the next semester**.

---

### Task Details

Play Minecraft and answer a few questions. If you’ve never played Minecraft before, we encourage you to ping the course discord and play with someone familiar with the game :)

### **Step 1: Choose Your Goal**

You may pick one of the following goals:

- **Tier 1**: Obtain a diamond.
- **Tier 2**: Craft a brewing stand.
- **Tier 3**: Defeat the Ender Dragon.

Feel free to pick one that best matches your comfort level in Minecraft.

### **Step 2: Two Playthroughs**

1. Playthrough One
    - Mode: **Any difficulty**, any play style you prefer.
    - Tip: Record any interesting moments, mechanics, challenges, or strategies as you go. These notes will help with your reflection.
2. Playthrough Two
    - Mode: **Hardcore mode**.
    - Tip: Notice how playing with a single life changes your decisions. Again, jot down your thoughts and feelings as you progress.

Throughout both playthroughs, pay attention to your goals, actions, and emotional reactions as a player—these observations will be critical for your write-up.

Note also any frustrations you may have interacting with the game in achieving your goals.

### **Step 3: Reflection & Write-Up**

After completing both playthroughs, submit a short write-up addressing the following:

1. **Experience Summary**: Briefly summarize each of your experiences. How did you feel in each?
2. **Strategy Differences:** Explain the differences in your gameplay strategies between the two playthroughs.

 No need to write a full essay (unless you feel like it). A few sentences will do.

### Submission Instructions

Please submit your write-up once we setup the canvas. We also encourage you to share your experience through discord!

### Minecraft Education Setup

If you don’t have access to the standard version of Minecraft, you can use **Minecraft Education**! It functions just like regular Minecraft, and, thanks to UPenn’s Office 365 subscription, all institution members have access to Minecraft Education, including **free multiplayer servers**—so you can play with others and share your achievements!

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Download Minecraft Education**
    
    Visit the official page:
	https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/get-started/download
    
2. **Log In**
    
    Use the same credentials you use for your Office 365 login:
    
    - **Account**: `pennkey@upenn.edu`*(Note: Do not use `pennkey@seas.upenn.edu`.)*
    - **Password**: Your PennKey password.
3. **Set Up Office 365 (If Needed)**
