**Description:**
In this guest lecture, veteran game designer Josh Nadel—known online as the creator of the These Mobs Minecraft mod—outlines a framework for evaluating and improving player‑submitted mob suggestions. He begins by defining a mob’s “hook” as its central gameplay thesis, then walks through key guidelines such as simplicity, coherence, balance, rule justification, and leveraging player preconceptions. With illustrative examples (both successful and flawed), he shows how each principle shapes memorable encounters. Finally, he highlights standout concepts like the Ender Imp and Forest Wrath to demonstrate how thoughtful design can deepen player interaction and enrich a game’s world.
