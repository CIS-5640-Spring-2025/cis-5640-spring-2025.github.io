**Description**

In this lecture, Ruipeng Wang explores the vital role of tutorials in onboarding players and lowering the learning curve. He contrasts static instructions with engaging, feedback rich tutorials, then breaks down core design principles—“show, don’t tell,” safe experimentation zones, minimal words, and spaced out learning using iconic examples: Super Mario Bros. 1 1’s hidden teaching moments, Plants vs. Zombies’ concise pop-up guidance, Minecraft’s sandbox and community powered learning, and Breath of the Wild’s Great Plateau masterclass. He also discusses balancing player empowerment and challenge across linear, open world, and sandbox games.
