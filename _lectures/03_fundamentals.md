**Description:**
In this lecture, we dive into the mechanics that make games compelling and engaging. We explore why players spend countless hours in games, identifying common motivators such as social play, progression, and mastery. The concept of games as machines is introduced, highlighting how game loops create an ongoing cycle of challenges, player actions, and feedback. Through examples like Tetris, chess, Minecraft, and The Sims, we analyze how different games structure their core loops to maintain engagement. The lecture also covers what makes a good loop, emphasizing clarity, motivation, feedback, and satisfaction. Finally, we discuss broken loops that lead to disengagement and explore design strategies to maintain player involvement.
