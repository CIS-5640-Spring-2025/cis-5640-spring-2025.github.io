title: Engaging Puzzle Design (4/10)
tldr: "This class deck presents five core elements—mechanics, catch & revelation, player knowledge, presentation, and difficulty curve—for crafting puzzles that drive player learning and “lightbulb” moments."

**Description:**
This class define puzzles as challenges that test player knowledge or skill and survey common puzzle types. They then introduce a five‑part design framework—establishing clear rules and goals (mechanics), creating a compelling problem and logical solution (catch & revelation), accounting for what players already know and their assumptions, optimizing layout and feedback (presentation), and tuning the challenge through a structured difficulty curve—emphasizing progression, feedback loops, and playtesting to ensure puzzles remain engaging and rewarding.
