**Description:**
Progression is one of the most powerful design tools in game development. Players are naturally drawn to systems that allow them to feel improvement over time, whether through skill mastery, accumulation, or unlocking new options. This lecture explores various forms of progression, from vertical skill-based challenges to horizontal expansion and psychological tricks like streaks, collection, and completionism. We also discuss the concept of flow state and how game difficulty should scale to match player improvement.

**Reference Games:**
Hades, Dark Souls, Elden Ring, Cookie Clicker, Overcooked, Stardew Valley, Tetris
