**Description**

In this session, we frames game design as a value‑driven practice, not a neutral technical exercise. Students share personal examples (e.g., Secret Hitler’s impact on trust, League of Legends fostering friendships during lockdown, Undertale’s humanistic themes, Dark Souls’ perseverance lessons), which lead into core ethics topics: the cultural and social impact of games, responsible production (labor practices, diversity in creative teams, pitfalls of tokenism), and inclusive play (accessibility options and community moderation). Real‑world cases—such as Blizzard’s contested diversity metrics, Pokémon Go’s geographic biases, and toxic behaviors in competitive titles—illustrate the stakes, while positive models highlight design choices that empower players and foster healthier communities.
