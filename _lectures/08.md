**Description:**
This lecture covered game system design, featuring guest speaker **Rick Ernst**, an experienced systems designer. Rick shared insights from his 32-year career in the industry, working on tabletop RPGs, Thief, Full Spectrum Warrior, Mechs vs. Minions, and his role at Riot Games.

The session explored the role of systems design, its interplay with other design disciplines, and approaches to designing interconnected systems. Using **Minecraft** as an example, the discussion broke down core systems such as crafting, mining, combat, and biome generation, emphasizing an additive design approachâ€”building systems iteratively and refining interactions.

The lecture also analyzed **Overcooked** to illustrate systematic breakdowns of game mechanics, highlighting task management, communication, and chaotic level design.

**Reference Games:**
