## **Project Options**

### 1. Develop Your Own Game
- Design and develop a digital game from scratch. 
- This can be a simple prototype that showcases innovative mechanics, engaging themes, or compelling player experiences.
- Tools like Unity, Unreal Engine, or Godot are encouraged, but you are free to use any platform or framework you are comfortable with.

### 2. Write a Research Paper About Games

- Your paper should critically analyze the topic, referencing existing games, academic papers, or industry practices.
- Suggested topics include (but are not limited to):
  - The impact of narrative in games.
  - Designing for accessibility in games.
  - The evolution of multiplayer systems.
  - Comparing player choice systems across genres.

### 3. Design a Board Game
