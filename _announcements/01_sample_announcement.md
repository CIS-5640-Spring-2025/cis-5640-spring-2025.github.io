Hey everyone!

First and foremost, I hope you’re all enjoying a well-deserved winter break.

I also am super excited to welcome you to CIS564, Intro to Game Design. If we haven’t met, I’m Rui (aka Rachel), your instructor. I along with our fabulous TAs (RuiPeng, Neha, Clara and Rain) will be facilitating and teaching this course. I hope we all have a lot of fun figuring out how to learn together.

Spoilers, because this is a class about games, some of our assignments will involve playing games. Since winter break is a wonderful time for playing video games, our TAs had the wonderful idea of releasing our first assignment early. 

No pressure at all to do anything before the semester starts (nothing will be due until the second week of class), but if the spirit moves you, feel free to play some minecraft thoughtfully to get ahead of the game :)

Please also join our class discord server! It will be an important space for gathering and discussion. If you’re not already on discord, now is your time to join! Create an account and use the link below to join.

Happy holidays all! I hope you are spending your time playing ✨

-Rui
